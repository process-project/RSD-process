However, it is difficult to get citizens involved in their society if they have no idea of how it came into being, and no understanding of its workings. Cultural participation and solid, up-to-date education in history, language and cultural subjects are of crucial importance in this context. And the foundations of these matters are laid by high-quality humanities research. As the Netherlands’ foremost humanities research institute, the Huygens Institute of Netherlands History (Huygens ING) plays a prominent role in this process.\n",

Nowadays, the most important tool in all scientific disciplines is the computer. In this digital era, eScience is the developing discipline that provides the domain overarching software instruments (software, workflows and protocols) to support diverse scientific initiatives - making possible the creation of new, even unforeseen, applications - with the potential to transform current scientific practice, optimize scientific investments and significantly accelerate scientific discovery. eScience has the potential to underpin all scientific endeavor in the same way that applied mathematics currently does.\n\nThe Netherlands eScience Center (NLeSC) is tasked with coordinating a collaborative scientific program, working with both academia and industry, to conduct funded projects fostering the development of overarching tools for the benefit of a broad scientific community. The success of NLeSC will be measurable by the growing adoption of eScience tools as a fundamental approach within diverse research domains. Based on its multidisciplinary collaborations and technological advances, NLeSC aims to become recognized as one of the leading eScience expertise centers in the world.\n",
